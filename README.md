# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
This repository is created for learning purpose only. I am new to Spring Boot Framework and want to learn it very deeply.

# About Repository
In this repository, I have consumed Google Books Search API in its raw form. "https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=<KEYWORD>"
replace KEYWORD with any book title you want to search with API.

# Problem I'm facing
When I try to search books with API that I created it's showing null. I request you to solve this issue.
I welcome all your suggestions and advice. üëè
